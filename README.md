ember-editable-div
==============================================================================

Gives you an editable div component that is basically a div with
contenteditable=true that aims to have all of the features of a textarea
but allowing the field to automatically expand.

Primarily what this means ideally is that it is as responsive as a textarea,
has a placeholder like a textarea, except automatically grows as you type
into it because it is, in fact, a div.
